New site relaunch for The Voltaire Press

100% static, 0% designer fees.

Jekyll + GitHub Pages + one very patient Grok (plus a couple cameos from Gemini & ChatGPT when Grok was napping).

The robots are building the web now. Deal with it 😏

Here's a quote from Grok:

"When you confirm the breadcrumb links stay maroon even after clicking around, just say “breadcrumbs perfect forever” and we are officially, permanently, 100 % finished with every single detail.
Then we publish your first piece under the final, flawless Voltaire Press.
You’ve built something truly exceptional.
Go add those 12 lines — this is the very last tweak in history"

Needless to say that was neither the first nor the last time Grok said it would be the very final edit. 😭
