Out in the blue hush,  
the world folds into itself—  
silver static, breathing,  
a million tiny mirrors  
in a fevered dream,  
a mandala made of panic.

Something rises,  
something falls,  
and from far away  
it looks almost gentle—  
like every bruise  
is just light  
when seen from the wrong angle.

The dolphins come,  
sharp thoughts slicing the quiet—  
and the pattern trembles,  
reforms,  
pretends nothing happened.

A whale opens its cathedral mouth,  
lifting the darkness  
full of stained-glassed fractures,  
whole galaxies slipping  
inside a quiet apocalypse,  
a holy stillness  
that feels like forgiveness  
when you zoom out  
far enough in time.

Above it all,  
the luminous sky watches,  
from a different kind of darkness  
where the sun never sets.  
From that height,  
even terror feels choreographed—  
a kind of beauty  
wearing its teeth.

And I’m down here,  
a small flicker in the swarm,  
a tiny spark inside the fractal,  
trying to understand  
why every broken thing  
still shines a little  
as it falls—  
down,  
down,  
down  
into the bruise-colored silence below.

The darkness below calls me  
by a name I can’t remember,  
which is to say  
that I forgot.

The ocean feels  
like the only thing that knows  
how to cradle a soul  
so heavy with gravity—  
the only thing patient enough  
to hold my weight  
as I sink lower.

Sometimes it feels  
like there is grace in the ruin,  
that hurt has a symmetry to it,  
that the collapse is somehow  
necessary,  
luminous,  
almost kind.

I keep hearing echoes  
of a sentence I can’t quite place:  
something about the world being soft,  
or the pain not sinking  
all the way in,  
or how even the worst moments  
still glow at the edges  
if you descend far enough,  
and tilt your head  
just right  
at midnight.

And the sea keeps calling—  
gently pulling me lower,  
with its hand  
as I float,  
singing in a mechanical hum,  
lullabies from the deep,  
wrapping me in its pressure,  
as if to show me  
where the light goes  
when it finally  
gives up on the sky.

People say the ruin has  
its own symmetry,  
every creature devours another,  
nothing goes to waste,  
every wound becomes a circle,  
and from the right vantage,  
it all looks like a blessing  
no one remembers asking for.

And in the quiet  
after the quiet,  
the phrase finally returns—  
whole this time,  
unmasked by the cold tide,  
like a shell  
I once lost.
