As the sinking sun
Is cloaked in black, 
The time is near,
No turning back.
‍
The steel of legend
Bathed in red, 
A mountain pass
Where heroes bled.
‍
A clash of words
Where shadows fight, 
To hide the beard
Of snowy white.
‍
When azure skies
Reveal their hue, 
The hidden truth
Shall come to view.
‍
- Voltaire
