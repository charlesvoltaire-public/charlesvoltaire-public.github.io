There was no end
to what I would do,
to be alone with you.

I left my family,
I forsook my friends,
I ventured into the night.
Then for a thousand years,
I fought my way,
through a burning lake of desire.

I battled with demons
I battled with gods,
I forsook them all the same.

Then gave up my dreams,
by selling my soul,
and erasing my every thought.

I wanted to live,
I wanted to love,
I never wanted to die.

And in that moment,
finally alone,
You drowned me in your eyes.

– Voltaire
