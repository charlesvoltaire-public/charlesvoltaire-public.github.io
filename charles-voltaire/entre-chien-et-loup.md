Walking down the alley  
The evening star arrives  
Another day has passed  
It’s time again  
The fading of the light  
Patterns of crimson and pink  
Dwindling fires of neon hues  
As I’m heading home  
I’ll squeeze the sun  
Till its very final drop

I hate when the wind  
Picks up like this  
The creaky open door  
Are you ready to do it all again  
Are you ready for the shadows  
Shadows which fall upon shadows  
Crowding out glowing patches  
Will you remember  
Did you forget  
Here comes the twilight

You take a look  
Out over the field  
Eyes straining to see  
And in the silence  
There echoes and resonates  
The beautiful sound of dusk  
Why did you wait  
You took so long  
Who’s watching you from the dark  
Is it man’s best friend  
Do you know their scent  
Will you know them  
For who they are

Last call  
The sun is almost gone  
Are you sure you’re ready  
Maybe you’d rather call it a night  
Go sit by the fireplace  
Someplace safe and warm  
Do you remember yet  
What you forgot  
When the time arrives  
Breath in deeply  
Remember the moonless night

– Voltaire
