My eyes open slowly
and at first,  
I don’t know where I am.

The smile in my heart
slowly creeps onto my face
as I smell the warm scent of you
on the sheets.

My first thought...
I run my hand softly down your skin
and as my hand begins to rise,
we lock eyes.

Cold sea water.
I’m floating on the surface at sunrise.
A cool offshore breeze
and warm coffee
greets me on board.

Gently bobbing,
your windswept hair
painted on your face.
A soft hum rolls across your lips.

My day is almost complete
even though it has only just begun.

— Voltaire
