Within your walls, a steadfast flame,  
where stone and spirit stake their claim.  
A bastion strong against the tide,  
where fearless truths and hopes reside—  
Ma Châtelet.

Beneath the moon’s soft silver gleam,  
a shadow moves through scholar’s dream.  
Thirst burns like fire, alive and bright,  
a hunger calls me through the night—  
Ma Louve.

Ma Louvre, my refuge, my wolf’s domain,  
where your echoes dance on a canvas frame.

Ma Louvre, within dreams’ embrace,  
in marble silence, your secret space.

Ma Louvre, Ma Châtelet  
You fell in fate, but I needed you.

Roots descend where silence speaks,  
in groves where time through stillness leaks.  
Strength woven deep in boughs that gleam,  
each falling leaf a fading dream—  
Ma Rouvre.

A life composed with strokes of time,  
where math and passion intertwine.  
A canvas born of bold design,  
a masterpiece, refined, divine.  
Each hue a story, deep and true,  
The vivid colors bleeding through.  
Ma Œuvre.

Ma Louvre, my refuge, my wolf’s domain,  
where your echoes dance on a canvas frame.

Ma Louvre, within dreams’ embrace,  
in marble silence, your secret space.

Ma Louvre, Ma Châtelet  
You fell in fate, but I needed you.

From your watchtower, I have seen  
the living force that flows between,  
time bending like a river’s stream,  
motion sparked by fire and dream.

Heat pulses through the silent air,  
a vibrant current everywhere—  
vis viva’s breath, a dance divine,  
a flame that burns beyond all time.

Ma Louvre, my refuge, my wolf’s domain,  
where your echoes dance on a canvas frame.

Ma Louvre, within dreams’ embrace,  
in marble silence, your secret space.

Ma Louvre, Ma Châtelet  
You fell in fate, but I needed you.

Could this hold true throughout all time?  
The fortress, the wolf, a silent rhyme…  
I reached for you,  
and now I walk as shadow,  
among the whispers of Ma Louvre.

– Voltaire
