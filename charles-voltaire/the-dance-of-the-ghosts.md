The dance of the ghosts In the fading twilight.  
A bob of the head,  
A whimper and cower,  
The walls filled with whispers,  
The door in a mirror,  
Her eyes filled with blood,  
Les yeux de la mort en azure.

The love was real  
Immortal and sweet.  
We cuddled with darkness  
Advancing around us.  
One hope,  
One chance,  
One slip through the cracks  
In the wall and my fingers.

I woke and I ran,  
I tried to catch up,  
Tripping with every step,  
Arrows from the tongue  
Stinging the soul.  
I died clutching for the mist  
That was her green eyes.

Reborn yet still alone,  
I saw her again.  
The paintbrushed hair in reverse,  
The mirrored temptation of shame,  
The heartache of loneliness,  
The beautiful angry lifeless eyes of love.

I hated her  
As she danced on my grave  
In the moonlight.  
I laughed and I cried.  
The friend I always wanted,  
Not a real ghost,  
But a ghost you can touch.  
Those puppy dog eyes,  
The ghost of a real ghost.

I slumber alone now  
In my dark room  
Forever and ever,  
And adorning my tomb,  
Is her beautiful dance,  
The inscription which writes,  
"Give me one ghost in place of another."
