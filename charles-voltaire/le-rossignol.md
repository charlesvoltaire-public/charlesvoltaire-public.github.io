When the sinking sun  
Has been erased  
And shadows melt into the night  
This is the hour of woken memories  
Regrets turn into ghosts  
A thousand years of tears  
To fill the empty hole  
The color blue

Undone by the cold  
But still awake  
I remember once in silence  
The sword which sliced the darkness  
The melody of courage  
The song reserved for men  
Te souviens-tu quand elle chantait

She should have been sad  
But unlike the banished queen  
She wore a crown  
A restless soul  
Wise and cunning  
Her chorus flowed  
Like water from a spring  
On parched soil

Singing like a requiem choir  
The never-ending song  
Like the morning star’s light  
To be forgotten again  
Drowned in the warmth of dawn

Do you remember  
When death waited reverently  
For the final reprise  
A holy silence  
The song’s surprise  
You held your breath  
And closed your eyes  
When everyone cried  
The nightingale’s song

Singing like a requiem choir  
The never-ending song  
Like the morning star’s light  
To be forgotten again  
Drowned at dawn

– Voltaire
